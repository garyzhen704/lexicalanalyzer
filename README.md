# Lexical Analyzer

A lexical analysis tool that reads source code from a .txt file, removes whitespace and comments, and tokenizes the input into keywords, operators, identifiers, separators, and literals. Outputs are formatted as `<lexeme> = <token>` for each identified token.

## How to Run

```bash
python3 main.py <input_file>
```

Output will be printed to console and saved to `output.txt`.
